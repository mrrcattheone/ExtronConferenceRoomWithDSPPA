UI made in Global Designer. Code is not clean. We realized autotracking function with three of cameras (each on it`s "sector") 
and integrated DSPPA D7201 conference host with RS232 commands. All drivers were taken from extron site and adopted to program.
Cameras are controlled by VISCA protocol. VideoWall is for RGBLink IC2+ and IC2 video transmitters control. 
Latest update: added a universal sender module to form a commands and objects queue with different priorities. This fixed a bug with incorrect camera movement.
Still in test mode.
